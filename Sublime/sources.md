#DOCUMENTATIONS
1. [Emmet Documentation](http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/types/)

in HTML and XML documents, when you expand abbreviations, all abbreviation parts are transformed on-the-fly into HTML/XML tags. But certain elements like a or img are transformed into elements with predefined attributes: \<a href=""\>\</a\> and \<img src="" alt="" \/>.
How does Emmet know when to add those attributes?
