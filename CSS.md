  * The first is that *relative* positioning will allow you to tweak an element’s position relative to its normal starting point.
  * The second is that *absolute* positioning will allow you to tweak an element’s position relative to its first non-statically-positioned ancestor (defaults to page bounds if none is found). 
  * The final piece of information to remember is that both relatively and absolutely positioned items won’t affect the static and fixed items around them (**absolutely positioned items are _removed from the flow_, relatively positioned items occupy their _original position_**).
